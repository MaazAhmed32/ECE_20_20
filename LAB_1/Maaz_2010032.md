## 1. Experiment No. 2

## 2. Experiment Name:  
Best Coding Practices

## 3. Objectives:  
- To understand and implement best practices in coding.
- To learn techniques that improve readability, reduce errors.

## 4. Source Code and Description:  

Here's a revised program that performs subtraction and a detailed description in Markdown format, focusing on best coding practices.

---

### **Source Code** (C++):
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int calDiff(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}

bool getInput(int &num) {
    std::cin >> num;
    if (std::cin.fail()) {
        std::cin.clear(); // Clear error flag
        std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n'); // Discard invalid input
        std::cerr << "Invalid input. Please enter an integer." << std::endl;
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    int num1, num2, difference;

    std::cout << "Enter first number: ";
    while (!getInput(num1)) {
        std::cout << "Enter first number: ";
    }

    std::cout << "Enter second number: ";
    while (!getInput(num2)) {
        std::cout << "Enter second number: ";
    }

    difference = calDiff(num1, num2);

    std::cout << "The difference is: " << difference << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Description**:
This example demonstrates the best coding practices through subtraction and introduces error handling and input validation.

#### 1. Variable Naming
Variables such as `num1`, `num2`, and `difference` are given descriptive names that make their purpose clear. This improves readability and helps developers quickly understand the function of each variable.

#### 2. Modular Functions for Reusability
- **`calDiff`**: Encapsulates the subtraction logic, enabling reusability and modularity. The function makes the code cleaner and allows for easy modifications in future.
- **`getInput`**: This function is dedicated to input handling and validation, making the main logic in `main` more concise and focused on program flow.

#### 3. Error Handling
The **`getInput`** function checks if the user input is a valid integer. If invalid input is detected, an error message is shown, and the input stream is cleared, allowing the user to retry. This ensures robust code that handles unexpected input gracefully.

#### 4. Input Validation
By separating the input validation into a distinct function, the code ensures only valid integers are accepted, thus preventing runtime errors and creating a smoother user experience.

#### 5. Modular and Reusable Structure
- Each function performs a specific task, which makes the code modular, allowing for easier debugging and future expansion.
- Changes to the core calculation (subtraction in this case) only require modifying the `calculateDifference` function without affecting other parts of the program.

#### 6. Readability and Formatting
The code follows a consistent indentation and formatting style, making it easy to read and maintain over time. Clear and concise comments aid in understanding the programâ€™s functionality.


## 1. Experiment No. 3

## 2. Experiment Name:
Exploring essential Git Commands

## 3. Objectives:
- To understand frequently used Git commands.
- To learn how to use Git for code management and effective collaboration.
- To practice using Git for handling repositories and tracking project changes.

## 4. Theory:
Git is a popular distributed version control system that enables developers to track code changes, work on different branches and merge updates seamlessly. It facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple contributors to work on the same project without conflicts. This experiment focuses on fundamental Git commands for creating, managing and updating repositories as well as effectively handling version control tasks.
### Common Git Commands:
1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
2. `git clone`: Copies an existing repository to a local machine.
3. `git status`: Shows the current state of the repository and any uncommitted changes.
4. `git add`: Moves changes to the staging area, preparing them for a commit.
5. `git commit`: Saves the staged changes as a snapshot in the repository.
6. `git log`: Displays the history of commits in the repository.
7. `git push`: Uploads changes from a local repository to a remote one.
8. `git pull`: Fetches and integrates updates from a remote repository into the local one.
9. `git branch`: Manages branches in a repository, creating or deleting them.
10. `git merge`: Merges changes from one branch into another.

## 5. Procedure:

1. **Initialize a Git repository**:
   - Run `git init` to set up a new Git repository in your current directory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

2. **Clone an existing repository**:
   - Use `git clone` to copy an existing repository from a remote server to your local machine.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```

3. **Check the repository status**:
   - Run `git status` to check the current status of the repository, including any unstaged changes.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

4. **Add changes to the staging area**:
   - Use `git add` to stage changes, making them ready for the next commit.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git add Labreport_1.txt
     git add .
     ```

5. **Commit the changes**:
   - Run `git commit` to save the staged changes with a descriptive commit message.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

6. **View the commit history**:
   - Use `git log` to display the history of commits made in the repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

7. **Push changes to a remote repository**:
   - Use `git push` to send local commits to a remote repository, like GitHub.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

8. **Pull updates from a remote repository**:
   - Run `git pull` to fetch updates from a remote repository and merge them into your local branch.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

9. **Create and switch branches**:
   - Use `git branch` to create a new branch and switch to it.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git branch feature-branch
     git checkout feature-branch
     ```

10. **Merge branches**:
    - Run `git merge` to merge changes from one branch into another.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git merge feature-branch
      ```

## 6. Source Code and Output:

### Commands:
```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Check repository status
git status

# Stage changes for commit
git add .

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push changes to a remote repository
git push origin main

# Pull updates from a remote repository
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch
git branch feature-branch

# Merge changes from a branch
git merge feature-branch
```

### Output:
Running these commands enables you to establish and manage a Git repository, track changes, and collaborate seamlessly with other developers.

## 7. Discussion:
This experiment provided practical experience with fundamental Git commands for effective version control in software projects.

1. **Repository Initialization**: The `git init` command creates a new repository, while `git clone` duplicates an existing one, allowing developers to manage projects locally and work with remote versions.

2. **Tracking Changes and Staging**: The `git status` command displays the current state of files, and `git add` stages modifications, getting them ready to be committed to the repository.

3. **Committing and Pushing**: `git commit` saves the current project state with a descriptive message about the updates. The `git push` command sends these changes to a remote repository, supporting team collaboration.

4. **Branching and Merging**: The `git branch` command creates and switches branches, enabling independent work on features or fixes. `git merge` combines these branches back together, integrating development progress.
